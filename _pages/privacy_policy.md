Through this Privacy Policy, and in compliance with Articles 12 and 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter **"GDPR"**) and Article 11 of the Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (**"LOPDPGDD"**), Pokecode informs Users using the Website about the processing of their personal data that may be collected through this and processed by Pokecode.

### DATA PROCESSED, LEGAL BASES, PURPOSES AND RETENTION PERIOD.

**Data processed**

Contact information. The User can contact Pokecode by telephone and email. The data processed will be the Name, email, telephone number and the content of the message transmitted to Pokecode.

**Legal Basis**

Consent of the data subject

**Purposes**

To attend and respond to requests, comments, suggestions. As well as to support the User during the use of the Website.

**Retention period**

The personal data will be processed by Pokecode for necessary period of time to answer the question and/or resolve the incident indicated by the User. These data will be blocked in order to comply with Pokecode's legal obligations and, once this period has expired, will be definitively deleted.

When using the Website, Pokecode uses the services of Plausible analysis software. This is software that, when tracking User data, this data is kept fully and securely encrypted. The purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track general traffic trends on the Website and not individual visitors. Each HTTP request sends the IP address and User agent to the server, so this is what they use, generating an identifier that changes daily using the visitor's IP address and User agent. To anonymize this data, it is passed through a hash function with a rotating salt. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that are used to calculate the number of unique visitors for the day. The IP address of the raw data and the User agent are never stored in the logs, databases or anywhere on Plausible analytics disk. Older salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next. In this way, no personal data is collected from the User while browsing our Web Site. For more information about data processing by Plausible Analytics, you can visit their Website at [https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).

### DATA COMMUNICATION

Pokecode informs that, for the fulfillment of the purposes described above, it will not transfer the User's personal data to third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pokecode may give access to such personal data to Technology Service Providers with whom it has entered into a processor contract; in particular to :

*   Database maintenance and newsletter subscription management service providers.
*   Analytical service providers.
*   Hosting service providers.
*   E-mail service providers.
*   Consent Management Platform Providers (Consent Management Platform)

The aforementioned providers may be located in jurisdictions that generally do not provide adequate safeguards in relation to the processing of personal data. For all entities that are not part of the European Economic Area (EEA), Pokecode has entered into contracts with such entities that include such safeguards, including the European Commission's model clauses.

Users may obtain more information about technology service providers by requesting the same from Pokecode through the means of contact provided in this privacy policy.

Also, the data may be transferred to:

*   Companies interested in buying or acquiring the company or a part of its business and, consequently, give access to any national or international auditor to carry out their due diligence.
*   Authorities to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, or the policies of the Website.

Pokecode undertakes to adopt the necessary technical and organizational measures, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable regulations, to ensure the security of personal data and to prevent the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the unauthorized communication of or access to such data. Personal data will be treated confidentially by Pokecode, which undertakes to inform and enforce, by legal or contractual obligation, such confidentiality to its employees, partners and any person who must have access to the User's personal data.
