position: "Co-President of the GPC Fund"
testimonial: |
  As a telecoms product manager, I managed software development from teams based in the US, the UK, Germany, Israel, and China. Pokecode consistently meets or surpasses the standards of those teams, delivering software reliably and responsibly; ahead of time, under budget, and with clear, accountable reporting. The caring, friendly attitude of the Pokecode team makes collaboration with them a joy, and we consider choosing them a key factor in the success of the Decidim project. We literally couldn't have done it without them.
