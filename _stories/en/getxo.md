position: "Getxo Town Hall"

  It will soon be the second anniversary since Getxo City Council joined the Decidim universe, creating its participation site [www.zeugaz.getxo.eus](https://zeugaz.getxo.eus/). From the very beginning, before even launching the platform, Ivan and Pau were our Jedi Masters, and we were their humble padawans. Always friendly, attentive, available, and precise, they guided us through an unfamiliar path.  

  But… they left. They left to fly free, to start their own company. We wished them the best and told them to have a wonderful time—those things you say when you miss someone before they leave.  

  And now, here we are again, working with them in their new phase at Pokecode. There must be a reason! We have returned to them and can confirm they are still just as friendly, attentive, available, and precise as before. Good luck on your new journey!
