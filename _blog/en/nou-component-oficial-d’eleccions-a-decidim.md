At Pokecode, we are very pleased to announce that the new official [elections](https://docs.decidim.org/en/develop/develop/elections.html) component for Decidim 0.31 is now available. This is a key development that we have built together with the Decidim Association and with the co-financing of Catalunya en Comú and the cooperatives Som Energia and Som Connexió.

A free and open-source component created with and for organizations that need reliable, secure, and easy-to-manage digital voting processes.

This project was one of the accepted talks within the framework of Decidim Fest 2025. You can watch the session here:  https://youtu.be/pK_dri0SLS8?t=1255

**A step forward for cooperatives: digital general assemblies with all guarantees**

One of the major new features is that the elections component allows cooperatives to hold their General Assembly completely digitally.

This means:

* Convenient management of candidacies and voting options
* Voting experience adapted for large volumes of participants
* A transparent, verifiable system aligned with Decidim's democratic principles

In a context where more and more organizations need hybrid or fully remote processes, this component becomes an essential tool for modernizing internal governance, reducing mobilization and logistical costs.

**Corporate Governance: a second component to go even further**

Alongside the Elections component, we have updated the [Corporate Governance](https://github.com/openpoke/decidim-module-action_delegator) component, designed for all small or medium-sized organizations that need solid management of their membership census.

This component allows you to:

* Create and manage an internal census using email, phone, or a combination of both (perfect for organizations without a CRM)
* Apply weighted voting, according to member type weighting
* Manage vote delegations easily and securely
* Import old consultations if the consultations module was used, to keep all historical data

**A collective development with real impact**

This development is the result of a joint push from the Decidim ecosystem. The Societal Governance component originated from a proposal by the Confederació de Cooperatives of Catalonia](https://cooperativescatalunya.coop/), which sought a tool to manage censuses, weighted voting, and delegations without depending on a CRM. At the same time, the need to recover functionalities from the deprecated Polls module has allowed these capabilities to return to the official Decidim core with a modern architecture. We have also leveraged the experience of the [Vocdoni module](https://github.com/decidim-vocdoni/decidim-module-vocdoni), developed by Pokecode with guidance from the Decidim Association, which allows voting with advanced cryptography for organizations requiring the highest level of security.

In summary, it is an example of the co-financing model and philosophy we champion at Pokecode, where various organizations contribute, and the entire Decidim ecosystem gains a real and permanent benefit. The final result shows what happens when different actors contribute their experience, needs, and resources. At Pokecode, we are proud to have coordinated and developed these components, but above all, we feel part of a community that grows Decidim in an open, shared, and sustainable way.

**Ready to take the step?**

If you have a cooperative, an entity, or an organization that needs to hold elections, digital assemblies, or manage a complex census, these two components can help you do it in a way that is:

✔ secure
✔ transparent
✔ easy to manage
✔ aligned with free software values

**Want information or a demo? Or do you have an idea for a new component/feature and need co-financing?**
