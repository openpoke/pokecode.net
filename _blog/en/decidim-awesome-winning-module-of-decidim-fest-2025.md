At Pokecode, we are very excited to announce that Decidim Awesome has been recognized as the winning module of Decidim Fest 2025! 🎉

This recognition is very special for us, as we are the **creators, developers, and maintainers of Decidim Awesome**, a module designed to take the Decidim experience to the next level: more flexible, more user-friendly, and much more powerful.


In fact, **if you’ve used Decidim, you probably didn’t know it, but Pokecode has already been offering you a better experience!**


Many of the improvements that make Decidim more pleasant and customizable come directly from **Decidim Awesome**.


#### Some of the features that make Decidim Awesome great:


**Menu Customization**


Surely at some point you’ve wanted to tweak Decidim’s menu… and you did it with Decidim Awesome! This feature allows you to easily adapt the navigation structure to your organization’s needs.


**Additional fields for proposals**


With the feature to add more custom fields to proposals, you’ve been able to create the exact form you were looking for - a more complete, clearer, and tailored to your participatory process.


**Custom Styles**


With this option, we’ve seen organizations create entire visual themes from scratch!


A great example is [participa.somenergia.coop](https://participa.somenergia.coop) showing how far customization with Decidim Awesome can go.


**Visibility restriction with the verifier**


Our latest addition allows you to restrict the visibility of components based on participant verification.


Imagine having a process open to everyone, but the proposals component is only visible to verified users - now it’s possible!


This provides maximum granularity in access control, and don’t worry: this information does not appear in the API, last activity, or open data - fully protected and aligned with Decidim’s privacy standards.


The **Decidim Awesome** module is made possible thanks to **co-funding from organizations that are our clients**, who support improving the platform collectively and openly.


That said, we **don’t always have all the resources we’d like** to maintain the pace we want.


If you feel like **contributing to co-funding**, we’d love the idea! 


And if not, **don’t worry - we continue updating the module regardless :)**


Right now, we’re working on **updating to version 0.31 of Decidim**, **without external resources**, to ensure that Decidim Awesome remains an essential, up-to-date, and reliable addition for the entire community.


The **Decidim Fest 2025 award** shows that the community recognizes this collective effort and the impact the module has had on projects around the world.


Thank you to all the people and organizations who trust us and help make Decidim a better space.


We will continue working with the same open, collaborative, and community-driven spirit that defines us 💜
