In the December 2025 session of the City Council, Barcelona City Council chose Pokecode to carry out the digital voting of the resolutions. The vote was conducted using the [new official Elections component](https://pokecode.net/blog/en/nou-component-oficial-d%E2%80%99eleccions-a-decidim.html) of Decidim, available from version 0.31 onwards.

You can watch the session at this link:

This component includes the functionality to upload a voter register using an identification number and a unique code for each person, making it possible to vote without being previously registered on the Decidim platform.

This feature is especially useful for collegiate bodies and in-person sessions, where precise control of the voter register and a smooth voting experience for participants are required.

**Live voting adapted to the agenda**

During the session, the live question submission feature was also used. This tool allows voting to be activated at the desired moment, according to the progress of the agenda, and the results to be published immediately, without the need to launch a second question.

This format is ideal for live voting in plenary sessions, such as the City Council, where the pace of the session may vary and a tool that adapts quickly and reliably is required.

**Pokecode’s Decidim SaaS service**

The vote was carried out using Pokecode’s Decidim SaaS service, a solution that can be contracted for a single vote, for one month, or for as long as needed, depending on the organization’s requirements.

This model provides a fully operational Decidim instance with specialized technical support, without the need to manage your own infrastructure.

**A very positive experience**

The voting process took place without any technical incidents and received very positive feedback from attendees, who especially valued the ease of use, the speed of the process, and the clarity of the results.

At Pokecode, we are very pleased that Barcelona City Council has trusted us for such an important vote, within such a key body as the City Council, which brings together the government team, Barcelona’s municipal groups, associative vice-presidencies, sectoral councils, relevant institutions, as well as organizations and citizens, together with the Ombudsman.

This experience reinforces our commitment to digital democracy, free and open-source software, and the development of reliable solutions for high-level institutional participation processes.
